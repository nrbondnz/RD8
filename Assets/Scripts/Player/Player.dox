 * \section secPlayer How Enimies input and movement work
 *
 * The unity object is attached to the player and that is what the 'player' will move via some input controls
 * This sets up the input controls (using the new input system in unity) and actions taken
 * As appropriate inputs are processed and then the Actions class is used to broadcast changes to interested consumers
 * Currently just the player object but could easily be an intelligent enemy as another consumer of change
 *
