Moves the player by adding force in the required direction TODO\+: This class is too complex and needs abstraction TODO\+: Remove the projection system in favour of a subscription model so if available it will react correctly The \+\_\+main\+Camera is needed to help direct the movement so its not confusing to the player, as it swings around to focus on the next waypoint TODO\+: When we get to more than IOS, mobile\+Multiplier will need extending for other devices during test probably.
