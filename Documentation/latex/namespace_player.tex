\hypertarget{namespace_player_secPlayer}{}\doxysubsection{How Enimies input and movement work}\label{namespace_player_secPlayer}
The unity object is attached to the player and that is what the \textquotesingle{}player\textquotesingle{} will move via some input controls This sets up the input controls (using the new input system in unity) and actions taken As appropriate inputs are processed and then the Actions class is used to broadcast changes to interested consumers Currently just the player object but could easily be an intelligent enemy as another consumer of change
